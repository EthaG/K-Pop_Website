            <img class="about-group-image" src="website_images/Enhypen_members.png">
            <p>Enhypen is a South Korean idol group formed by Belift Lab,
                formerly a joint venture between CJ ENM and Hybe Corporation,
                through the 2020 survival competition show I-Land. The group 
                consists of seven members: Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo,
                Jungwon, and Ni-ki. They debuted on November 30, 2020.
            <p>The name Enhypen was introduced during the live broadcast of the 
                final episode of I-Land. Etymologically, the group derives their 
                name from the hyphen symbol (-), representing "Connection, Discovery, 
                & Growth". Similar to how a hyphen connects different words to create 
                new meanings, Enhypen aims "to come together to connect, discover and 
                grow together to form a new act".</p>
            <p>Enhypen's fandom name was announced on October 8, 2020 to be Engene. 
                Engene combines the words engine, en (from 'en'hypen), and gene. The name 
                carries two meanings. One of them describes how fans represent a source of 
                fuel and energy for Enhypen to move forward, similar to an 'engine'. The second 
                meaning comes from the combination of en + gene, which represents the connection 
                between Engene and fans through a common gene.</p>
